/**
 * A specification of an object.
 *
 * A specification defines how an object is created.  The specification includes
 * a "factory" which is used to create objects.  A factory is typically a
 * function which returns the object or a constructor that is invoked with the
 * `new` operator.  A specification also declares any objects required by the
 * object.  Any such required objects will be injected into the object when it
 * is created.
 *
 * A specification also contains annotations, which are used by the IoC
 * container when creating an object.   These annotations are:
 *
 *   - `@require` - Declares other objects needed by this object.
 *   - `@singleton` - Declares whether or not a single instance of this object
 *                    should be created.
 *   - `@implements` - Declares the interfaces implemented by this object.
 *
 * A specification may contain other annotations, and the complete set of
 * annotations is available under the `.a` hash (short for annotations).  Such
 * annotations are typically used by higher-level frameworks for purposes such
 * as declaring service endpoints and loading plug-ins.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} id - The id of the component.
 * @param {object} mod - The module containing the component specification.
 * @param {number} asm - The assembly from which the component was loaded.
 * @protected
